## Main-Menu

An undergraduate Java course project created during the Fall 2017 semester.  The task of this assignment required each team to create an application using Java.

Based on food delivery services, this application replicates services such as Uber Eats in which a user can do the following:
- Customer:
  - Select a Restaurant
  - Order Food
- Driver:
  - Select Meal to Deliver
- Restaurant:
  - Add Restaurant
  - Update Menu
  - Track Orders

As this README is being updated several years after this project was last updated, there is likely more missing. As it is unlikely that this project will ever be touched again, it is being archived.
